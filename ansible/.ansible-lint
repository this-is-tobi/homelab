# Ansible-lint configuration for homelab project

# Exclude paths from linting
exclude_paths:
  - .cache/
  - .git/

# Skip rules that require major refactoring of existing variable names
# The inventory uses camelCase variables (k3sVersion, rootDomain, etc.)
# which are used throughout the project and would be breaking changes
skip_list:
  - var-naming[pattern]  # Skip camelCase variable naming in inventory files
  - role-name[path]  # Project uses nested role structure (common/*, gateway/*, k3s/*)

# Warn only for certain rules
warn_list:
  - var-naming[no-role-prefix]  # Warn but don't fail for role prefix naming
  - yaml[line-length]  # Warn for long lines but don't fail (some base64 data is unavoidable)

# Enable offline mode to speed up linting
offline: false

# Set profile to basic
profile: basic
