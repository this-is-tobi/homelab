## Gateway

A host is configured as the gateway to the local network (*i.e handle all incoming traffic*). It runs various services deployed via docker :

- [Openvpn](https://openvpn.net/) for external access to the local network (*i.e from internet*). An openvpn client conf is generated for each admin user declared in ansible `group_vars`.
- [Haproxy](https://www.haproxy.org/) for loadbalancing all incoming external requests (*ports 80 & 443*) to the k3s cluster and loadbalancing k3s api server (*port 6443*).
- [Crowdsec](https://www.crowdsec.net/) for security purpose as it acts as a community firewall.

## Bastion

A host is configured as the bastion to access kubernetes ressources. As previously mentioned, an openvpn profile conf is autogenerated for every `bastion_users` set in [group_vars/all.yml](../ansible/inventory-example/group_vars/all.yml).

Bastion is available on the local network using ssh :

1. Connect to the vpn using the proper autogenerated openvpn user profile conf.
2. Connect to the bastion using `ssh <username>@<bastion_ip> -i <ssh_key>`.


## K3S cluster

Some hosts are configrured to run [k3s](https://k3s.io) (*Lightweight Kubernetes*) with the following roles :
- 3 x master nodes
- 5 x worker nodes

The cluster comes with k3s integrated [klipper](https://github.com/k3s-io/klipper-lb) loadbalancer and [traefik](https://traefik.io/) ingressController.
For convenience, [system-upgrade-controller](https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller) is deployed to perform an automatic k3s upgrade on each node by using two plans (one for masters and the other one for workers).

[Longhorn](https://longhorn.io/) is used to deliver distributed block storage accross kubernetes, it will enroll all servers tagged `additional_disk: true` in [inventory/hosts.yml](../ansible/inventory-example/hosts.yml).
